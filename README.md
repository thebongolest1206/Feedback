CoFH Feedback Repository
====================================
#### Okay, so here's the deal.

This repository is for tracking bugs and providing suggestions for ALL CoFH mods. It's far easier for us to check one place instead of 6 or 7. Use the issue tracker associated with this repository for bug reports and feature suggestions.

#####If your game is crashing on startup:
- The issue is practically guaranteed to be on your end. This is not tech support, please check the IRC. The link is below.
- Update to Java 8. Uninstall Java 6.
- Update your mods! Use mods ONLY from http://teamcofh.com/downloads.
- Be sure you do not have duplicates of mods.
- Make sure you've done the above.
- Seriously, if you are crashing on startup, it is almost certainly something you have done incorrectly.
- Try to make the crash happen with just CoFH mods - nothing else.
- If that last step worked, you may have a mod-conflict. Update all of your mods.
- If you still have an actual issue, report away!

#####If you want to report a bug:
- Include the mod name and version.
- Include a pastebin (or equivalent) link to a list of all your mods.
- Include the crash log
- Be descriptive.
- Use proper grammar and spelling.

If you can't do the above, please do not report any bugs.

#####If you have a suggestion:
- Include the mod name.
- Provide a reason.
- Be descriptive.
- Use proper grammar and spelling.

If you cannot do the above, please do not suggest any features.
